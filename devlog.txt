* Added filler data for /student/opportunities and /student/opportunity routes to assist frontend dev (before real fxnaliy established)
  * /opportunities returns a list of dicts called 'data'
  * /opportunity returns a single dict (also called 'data')
  * Dict keys are: "name", "description", "organization", "start_time", "end_time", "hours", "deadline", "required_materials", "tags", "users_following", "link"
